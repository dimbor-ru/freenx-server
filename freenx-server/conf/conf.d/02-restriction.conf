# The base display number from which sessions are started.

# The maximum number of contemporary sessions that can be run on FreeNX
#SESSION_LIMIT=200

# The maximum number of contemporary sessions that a single user can run
# on FreeNX. Defaults to the value of SESSION_LIMIT.
#SESSION_USER_LIMIT=200

# The number of displays reserved for sessions, it has to be greater or equal
# to the maximum number of contemporary sessions that a server can run.
#DISPLAY_LIMIT=200


# User for which sessions should be persistent. Either the keyword "all" or a
# comma-separated list of usernames or groups in the @groupname syntax.

# Users and groups for whom persistent sessions should be disabled.

# This enables the mirroring of running sessions via VNC feature.

# Session is marked as resumable and type is vnc-mirrored.

#ENABLE_MIRROR_VIA_VNC=1

# This enables the sharing of :0 via VNC feature.

#
# General shadowing / mirroring notes:
#
# By default shadowing is only allowed for the same user.
#
# If nxserver finds nxshadowacl binary, it asks it, for which users 
# the permission is granted.
# 
# nxshadowacl <user>
# 
# Exit code:
#
# 0 -> Save cookie in session file for other users
# 1 -> Do not save cookie
#
# Check if user is allowed to be shadowed by admin user.
#
# nxshadowacl <user> <admin>
# 
# Exit code:
#
# 0 -> Yes, allow shadowing and add to list
# 1 -> No, don't allow shadowing
# 

#
# When using NX 3.0 shadowing, this enables asking the user whether
# he authorizes another user to shadow his session
#
# 0: No authorization request will be presented,
#    and the session will be shadowed as if the user had approved.
# 1: (default) Ask for authorization
#
#ENABLE_SESSION_SHADOWING_AUTHORIZATION=1

# Allow session shadowing in interactive mode:
#
# 1: The shadowing user can interact with the shadowed session.
#
# 0: The shadowed session is view-only. No interaction with the
#    shadowed session is possible.

#ENABLE_INTERACTIVE_SESSION_SHADOWING=1

# Enable or disable clipboard:
#
# client:  The content copied on the client can be pasted inside the
#            NX session.
#
# server: The content copied inside the NX session can be pasted
#             on the client.
#
# both:    The copy&paste operations are allowed both between the
#             client and the NX session and vice-versa.
#
# none:   The copy&paste operations between the client and the NX
#            session are never allowed.

#
# Enable or disable the pulldown dialog, which provides a graphical
# way to suspend or terminate the rootless session:
#
# 1: Enabled. The pulldown menu is shown when the mouse pointer
#     moves near the middle of the top boundary of a window and
#     allows the user to suspend or terminate the session by means
#     of an icon-click.
#
# 0: Disabled. The ctrl+alt+T key combination has to be issued
#     to get the dialog for suspending or terminating the session.
#
#ENABLE_PULLDOWN_MENU="1"


# The option USE_PROCESSOR_TASKSET is for setting the CPU affinity of all
# nx related processes.
#
# Note: To have for example startkde run on even another core, just specify:
#
# COMMAND_STARTKDE="taskset -c 2 -- startkde"
#
# FreeNX runs this option like: $COMMAND_TASKSET -cp "$USE_PROCESSOR_TASKSET" $$
# 
# So with $USE_PROCESSOR_TASKSET set to 3,4 it would balance the tasks to cores
# 3 and 4.
#
# If this option is empty, no balance to cores is done.
#
#USE_PROCESSOR_TASKSET=""

# If you set ENABLE_ADVANCED_SESSION_CONTROL="1" you can start a new application in an already
# running rootless session by using "add <rest of name>" as session name.
#
# Note: The client will return a message on that.
#
#ENABLE_ADVANCED_SESSION_CONTROL="0"

# If you set ENABLE_SHOW_RUNNING_SESSIONS="0" then nxserver will only show
# suspended sessions and you will not be able to resume or terminate a running 
# session.
