# both, either SMB and CIFS protocol are supported, this is the default value.
# smbfs, only SMB protocol is supported.

# FreeNX with ENABLE_SAMBA_PRELOAD="1" will automatically setup
# port 445 and 139 and forward them to the used samba port.

#ENABLE_SAMBA_PRELOAD="0"

# Additional mount options for mount command (mount.cifs)
# Eg: SMB_MOUNT_OPTIONS="iocharset=utf8,codepage=cp866,file_mode=0660,dir_mode=0770"
