# The maximum number of contemporary sessions that can be run on FreeNX
#SESSION_LIMIT=200

# The maximum number of contemporary sessions that a single user can run

# Users and groups for whom persistent sessions should be disabled.

# This enables the mirroring of running sessions via VNC feature.

# General shadowing / mirroring notes:
#
# By default shadowing is only allowed for the same user.
# If  ENABLE_NXSHADOWACL="1", we use nxshadowacl binary to check
# for which users the permission is granted.

# 0 -> Save cookie in session file for other users

# nxshadowacl <user> <admin>
# 
# Exit code:
#
# 0 -> Yes, allow shadowing and add to list
# 1 -> No, don't allow shadowing

#
# When using NX 3.0 shadowing, this enables asking the user whether

# Enable or disable the pulldown dialog, which provides a graphical

#
# 1: Enabled. The pulldown menu is shown when the mouse pointer
#     moves near the middle of the top boundary of a window and
#     allows the user to suspend or terminate the session by means
#     of an icon-click.
#
# 0: Disabled. The ctrl+alt+T key combination has to be issued
#     to get the dialog for suspending or terminating the session.

# The option USE_PROCESSOR_TASKSET is for setting the CPU affinity of all
# nx related processes.
#
# Note: To have for example startkde run on even another core, just specify:
#
# COMMAND_STARTKDE="taskset -c 2 -- startkde"
#
# FreeNX runs this option like: $COMMAND_TASKSET -cp "$USE_PROCESSOR_TASKSET" $$
# 
# So with $USE_PROCESSOR_TASKSET set to 3,4 it would balance the tasks to cores
# 3 and 4.
#
# If this option is empty, no balance to cores is done.
#
#USE_PROCESSOR_TASKSET=""

# If you set ENABLE_ADVANCED_SESSION_CONTROL="1" you can start a new application in an already
# running rootless session by using "add <rest of name>" as session name.
#
# Note: The client will return a message on that.
#
#ENABLE_ADVANCED_SESSION_CONTROL="0"

# If you set ENABLE_SHOW_RUNNING_SESSIONS="0" then nxserver will only show

#ENABLE_SHOW_RUNNING_SESSIONS="0"

# If value of this option not empty (valid dir) "run-acls" system is switch on:
# On session start (node_find_application) called script named nxacl.apps. Script parse
# ACLS-files in NX_ACL_DIR and search user/group permissions for given cmdstr.
# ACLS filenames are usernames, groupnames and "all". Permissions search order:
# user - group - all. See $NX_ETC_DIR/acls/README for detail
# Example: NX_ACL_DIR="/etc/nxserver/acls"
